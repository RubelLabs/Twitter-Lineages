# As of the September 11th, 2025 I have thought of my project title.
# It is called "Twitter Lineages"
# It uses graph theory to find the shortest path between two people in a social network.
# Essentially you enter your Twitter handle and the program will find the shortest path between you and a bunch of famous people in the world.
# It's based on the Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon.

# It will cover the 5 celebrities Elon Musk, Donald Trump, ... T.B.D.
